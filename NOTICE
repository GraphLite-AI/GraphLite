AI-Assisted Development:

This software was developed using claude code as a pair programmer, with occasional contributions from other similar coding agents. However, there was rigorous human oversight of AI generated code including thorough testing and manual review.

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and approved by human contributors.

The use of AI tools does not alter the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0, under which this project is licensed. All contributors—past, present, and future—provide their contributions under the same license and disclaimers.
