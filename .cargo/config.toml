# GraphLite Cargo Configuration
# This file configures cargo behavior for the GraphLite project

[env]
# Run tests single-threaded by default to avoid database state conflicts
# GraphLite tests share database instances and must not run in parallel
# to prevent race conditions and state interference between tests.
#
# Users can override this setting if needed:
#   RUST_TEST_THREADS=4 cargo test
RUST_TEST_THREADS = "1"
