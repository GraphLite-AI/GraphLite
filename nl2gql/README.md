# NL2GQL Inference Pipeline

This is a placeholder README for the upcoming natural language to ISO GQL inference pipeline. Documentation for setup instructions, usage patterns, and troubleshooting notes will go here.

## Environment configuration

Copy `nl2gql/config.example.env` to `nl2gql/config.env` and fill in the required API keys before running the pipeline. The `.gitignore` file excludes `config.env`, so you can safely keep your real credentials local.
